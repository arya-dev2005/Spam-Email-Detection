# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection using TensorFlow & Keras

This project uses a deep learning approach with Bidirectional LSTM to detect spam emails from text data.
It includes preprocessing, tokenization, model training with callbacks, and comprehensive evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Tokenization & Padding
- Bidirectional LSTM with Dropout
- Model Checkpointing & Early Stopping
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- Automatic Best Model Saving (.keras)

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Accuracy:** 99%

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ§ª How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python spam_detection.ipynb
```
